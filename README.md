# Phaser World Explorer
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/phaser-discord/phaser-world-explorer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/phaser-discord/phaser-world-explorer)

Phaser World Explorer is a React app we created to let you look through the contents of the Phaser World newsletters more easily. It shows a list of all newsletters (that we have gathered data for), and has a structured overview of the contents of the newsletters. You are also able to search through the newsletters for a specific word or phrase.
